## College Football 2022 Predictions
For this assignment, we have chosen to analyze college football data from the past twenty years to predict the outcomes of the games in Week 11 (Nov. 12) for the 2022 season. We chose this topic, because all three of us are interested in college football and are interested to see how the rest of this season plays out. During our analysis, we hope to answer a few other questions, such as the validity of a “home team advantage” and how outcomes vary based on conference.
